# Status of Steelhead Populations and Habitats in British Columbia

Clare Atkinson 07/2022

## Overview

Since 2008, the Pacific Salmon Foundationâ€™s (PSF) [Salmon Watersheds Program](https://salmonwatersheds.ca/) has worked to synthesize the best available data on Pacific salmon, evaluate the status of salmon populations and their habitats, and make information broadly accessible. In 2016, PSF launched the [Pacific Salmon Explorer](https://www.salmonexplorer.ca/#!/), an online data visualization tool that allows those interested in salmon conservation and management to access baseline data and assessments relevant to Pacific salmon. Using this innovative tool, professionals and the public can explore salmon datasets through interactive maps and figures for individual salmon Conservation Units (CUs). 

To leverage this successful tool to improve the availability of information about steelhead and their habitats, PSF is working to expand the Pacific Salmon Explorer to include the best-available data for steelhead in British Columbia. We hope to apply methodologies developed to evaluate the status of salmon CUs, and pressures on their freshwater habitats, to steelhead in the regions visualised on the Pacific Salmon Explorer. [This project](https://salmonwatersheds.ca/projects/steelhead-a-snapshot-of-bc-populations-and-their-habitats/) is one component of a broader initiative funded by the [British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund (BC SRIF)](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/initiatives/fish-fund-bc-fonds-peche-cb/index-eng.html) to update, expand, and mobilize the information provided in the Pacific Salmon Explorer between April 2021 and March 2024. 


## Files

TO BE EDITED...
What are the files and folders contained in this repo and what do they do? Can be a file-by-file explanation (good) or a general overview (less good but likley the norm; e.g., This repo contains R code to reproduce the regional summaries shown in the Pacific Salmon Explorer landing page.)
