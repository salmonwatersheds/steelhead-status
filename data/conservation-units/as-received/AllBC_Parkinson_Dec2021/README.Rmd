PSF compiled historical files underlying the work done by Parkinson et al. (2005), "A population database for defining conservation units in steelhead trout", to define steelhead CUs for the whole of BC. These files were used as the unit of analysis for steelhead CUs in all PSE Regions apart from the Skeena. Some modifications were made to coastal winter-run steelhead CU boundaries, which are documented in the [Pacific Salmon Explorer Technical Report](https://salmonwatersheds.ca/document/lib_475/). The full collection of these files are too large to upload to Github. However, PSF will make them available upon request. Please contact [info\@salmonwatersheds.ca](mailto:info@salmonwatersheds.ca){.email} if you would like access to these files.
