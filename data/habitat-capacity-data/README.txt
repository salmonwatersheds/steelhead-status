*Collating habitat capacity estimates for steelhead to use to derive benchmarks for status assessments*

Clare Atkinson, PSF

* Compiled reports on past work to determine habitat capacity estimates for steelhead streams in BC inn hc-lit.

* Scraped data from reports: Ideally minimum number of spawners to fully seed habitat, max fry and smolt capacity. In some cases only there were no estimates of min spawners to seed habitat, but there were estimates of spawners at Rmax or MSY based on habitat capacity model. Scraped these values in those cases. Relevant data pulled from reports in hc-lit. 

*Collated available estimates of minimum number of spawners to fully seed habitat where availabled (river-level and aggregates) in "sh_hc_collated". Included estimates of spawners at Rmax and MSY where available. Didn't include estimates of max fry/smolt habitat capacity, but these are in the spreadsheet of scraped data from each paper in the folder hc-lit.
