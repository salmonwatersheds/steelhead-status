Houston, B.C.. At a point about 6 kilometers north-west of Houston, the
Bulkley is joined by the much larger Morice River. The river then flows in a
general northwesterly direction for 120 kilometers to its confluence with the
Skeena River at Hazelton. The Bulkley is a relatively stable river, being largely lake-headed (Morice Lake, Bulkley Lake). The portion above Telkwa usually remains clear and stable throughout the summer and fall, but below this point the Bulkley tends to be influenced by weather conditions in the upper Telkwa River drainage. The Telkwa is a volatile, glacial stream that can be quite ""flashy"" and can affect the fishability of the Bulkley during the steelhead season. However, unfishable conditions even below Telkwa, are relatively uncommon.

Morice Lake is a large, deep and cold body of water lying in a depression at the base of the eastern slopes of the Coast Mountains providing a moderating influence on Morice River temperatures, flows, and sediment loads so critical to the Morice steelhead populations. Logging and recreation are the major activities within the Morice Drainage area. Access to the major portion of the Morice is gained via the Morice Forest Road, originating near Houston, which runs adjacent to the river for approximately 50 km. The final 25 km. are accessible only by boat upstream from the end of the road, or downstream from the lake. Access from Burns Lake and Francois Lake is also gained by a road which enters the valley via a route along Nadina River (Fraser drainage) and Owen Creek.

The river has two major tributaries; the Clore River, which enters 37 km upstream of the Skeena confluence, and the Kitnayakwa River, which enters 46 km upstream of the Skeena confluence. The Clore River is the largest tributary and in turn receives
considerable discharge from the Burnie River, whose headwaters lie in Burnie Lake at the foot of the Howson Range, 61 km upstream of the Zymoetz/Clore confluence. The Zymoetz River is relatively steep and is punctuated by two canyons, 6.4 and 9.6 km upstream of the Skeena confluence. Access by fish to the Zymoetz is impaired by gradientinduced
barriers on the mainstem in these canyons, and prevented by blockages (falls, chutes, and beaver dams) on some tributaries. Alkalinity 19.2 mg/L",,Maintinance of good logging practices,Maintenance of quality angling opportunites.,,Steelhead Catch and Release,
