"Table 5.1. Steelhead escapement estimates to the Cheakamus River, 1996-2019. Mean and CV denote the mean and coefficient of annual escapement estimates. Average values of escapement from juvenile fish which reared under pre-Instream Flow Agreement (pre-IFA), IFA, and Water Use Planning (WUP) periods are shown at the bottom of the table. IFA periods are separated by returns that were not and were affected by the CN caustic soda spill (pre-spill and post-spill periods, respectively).",,,,,,
