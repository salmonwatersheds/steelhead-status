"Table 4.4. Calculations used to estimate annual egg deposition for Steelhead in the Cheakamus River in years when information on sex ratio and size is available from angling surveys. Egg deposition is computed as the product of escapement, the proportion females, and fecundity. The latter estimates are computed based on mean female fork length and a fecundity-fork length relationship from the Keogh River (Ward and Slaney 1993).  Also shown are estimates of egg deposition for resident rainbow trout (based on average fork length of females and proportion females across all years when samples were available), and estimates of the proportion of eggs contributed by resident rainbow trout relative to the total egg deposition from Steelhead and resident trout.",,,,,,,,,,
