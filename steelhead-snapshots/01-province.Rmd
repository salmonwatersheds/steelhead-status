# Provincial Overview {#province}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(province). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).


You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
