# Provincial Overview {#province}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(province). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(tbr).

For each CU:
Figures: 
•	Spawner Surveys eg. Cheakamus river
•	Juvenile Surveys eg. Black Creek 
•	Hatchery Releases eg. choose
•	Spawner Abundance eg. Upper Sustut
•	Run Timing no eg. – Need data sources 
•	Catch and Run Size no eg. Only Nass, exploring Skeena 
•	Recruits-per-Spawner eg. Keogh?
•	Trends in Spawner Abundance eg. Upper Sustut 
•	Biological Status eg. Upper sustut 


For all 36 CUs – summary information about each indicator? 
CU-info
•	Number of steelhead streams (from Parkinson) and stream names 
•	Number of monitored streams (any years) and stream names + method + time series 
•	Run = winter, coastal summer, interior summer  
•	For each indicator (8): available data visualized or comment on availability or DD 
•	Bio status + benchmarks + method
•	Generation length and source of estimate 
•	Data quality? 



You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
