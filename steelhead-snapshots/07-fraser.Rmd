# Fraser {#fraser}

Here is the information available for steelhead CUs in the Fraser region. Steelhead CUs in this region were defined in [Parkinson et al. 2005](https://salmonwatersheds.ca/library/lib_521/).

## *Mid Fraser Summer*

CU id: 780

### Populations 

```{r echo=FALSE}
cu_list <- read.csv("_bookdown_files/steelhead_cu_population_lookup_2022.csv")


cu_list[ (cu_list$cu_id %in% c("780")), c(3,4,11)]

### Spawner Surveys 

![The figures display the number of spawning steelhead observed in each stream each year. Data Source: Robert Bison (Province of BC).](_bookdown_files/Steelhead9857.ind.stream.jpg)

_Spawner survey data are collected by BC Hydro for the Bridge and Seton Rivers (see [Buchanan et al. 2020](https://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/environment-sustainability/water-use-planning/lower-mainland/brgmon-9-yr7-2020-08-31.pdf) & [White et al. 2021](https://www.bchydro.com/content/dam/BCHydro/customer-portal/documents/corporate/environment-sustainability/water-use-planning/lower-mainland/brgmon-3-yr8-2021-02-24.pdf)). PSF is working to develop a data-sharing agreement with BC Hydro._

### Hatchery Releases 

_Data will be available for this indicator, pending processing - comprehensive database of steelhead hatchery releases from the Province of BC and Freshwater Fisheries Society._

### Spawner Abundance 

![This figure shows time series of the observed and estimated number of adult steelhead returning to the spawning grounds each year within the Conservation Unit (CU). Estimated spawner abundance is based on the number of effective total spawners, or the number of fish that successfully spawn in a given year. Fish that do not survive to spawn due to in-river mortality are not included in the spawner abundance estimates. Data Source: Robert Bison (Province of BC).](_bookdown_files/780.spawn.jpg)

### Spawner Surveys 

_Spawner data are available for the Alouette and Chilliwack-Vedder Rivers (ex. Schick & McNair 2020). Some of these data are published and will be extracted from PDFs in due course. Some are not published and have not been made available to PSF at this time. PSF is working with BC Hydro to develop a data sharing agreement._
