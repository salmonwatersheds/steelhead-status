### Spawner Abundance 

![This figure shows time series of the observed and estimated number of adult steelhead returning to the spawning grounds each year within the Conservation Unit (CU). Estimated spawner abundance is based on the number of effective total spawners, or the number of fish that successfully spawn in a given year. Fish that do not survive to spawn due to in-river mortality are not included in the spawner abundance estimates.
